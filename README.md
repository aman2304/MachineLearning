# MachineLearning
This is a collection of software modules and scripts that help solve various Machine Learning problems. I will try to focus on problems that are difficult to find in standard library packages.


I will add code for the following problems:

1. Linear Regression using l1 (lasso) penalty - A hard problem because of its obvious non-differentiability.
2. Sparse Covariance Estimation for a multivariate Gaussian - Estimation of the covariance matrix of a Gaussian using samples drawn from the (unknown) Gaussian. A seemingly standard problem that is surprisingly hard. 
3. Logistic Regression using l1 (lasso) penalty - self-explanatory.
4. Implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm for HMMs - Learning HMM parameters when no tagged data is available.
