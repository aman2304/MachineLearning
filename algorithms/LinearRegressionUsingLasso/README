Performs linear regression with l1-regularization, also popularly known as lasso regression

The objective function is the following:

||y - X*w||^2 + lambda * ||w||_1

where y is a vector of n real values. X is an nxd matrix of n samples of d-dimensions each. Lambda is the tuning parameter for penalizing the size of the feature vector w.

Example script to run the code:

% Generate some X values
X = [1 2; 1 3; 1 4; 1 5; 1 6 ; 1 7];
% Generate some y values
y = [1;2;3;4;5;6];
%Run linear regression method to learn weights, lambda is 0.1, tolerance is 10^-5, number of iterations is 1000
w = linear_regression_l1(X, y, 0.5, 1e-5, 1000, zeros(size(X,2),1))
