Performs linear regression with l1-regularization, also popularly known as lasso regression

The objective function is the following:

||y - X*w||^2 + lambda * ||w||_1

where y is a vector of n real values. X is an nxd matrix of n samples of d-dimensions each. Lambda is the tuning parameter for penalizing the size of the feature vector w.
